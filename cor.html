                    <p style="color: #708A58;">What is Python? Executive Summary
                        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic
                        semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic
                        binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a
                        scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to
                        learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
                        Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The
                        Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form
                        without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

                        Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.
                        Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging
                        Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when
                        the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the
                        exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of
                        local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping
                        through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself,
                        testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a
                        program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes
                        this simple approach very effective..</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-2" style="color: #FFB823;">Java</h4>
                    <p style="color: #708A58;">Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is
                        intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[18] meaning that compiled Java code
                        can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[19] Java applications
                        are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of
                        the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
                        low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such
                        as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
                        compiled languages.

                        Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language
                        since then.[20] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to
                        GitHub.[21] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in
                        recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[22]

                        Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core
                        component of Sun's Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers,
                        virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May
                        2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed
                        most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle, which bought Sun in 2010,
                        offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference implementation is
                        the OpenJDK JVM, which is open-source software used by most developers and is the default JVM
                        for almost all Linux distributions.

                        Java 24 is the version current as of March 2025. Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are long-term support
                        versions still under maintenance.</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-3" style="color: #FFB823;">Full Stack Dovelopment</h4>
                    <p style="color: #708A58;">Full Stack Development is a comprehensive approach to web development where a developer is
                        proficient in both frontend and backend technologies, allowing them to build complete,
                        end-to-end applications. On the frontend, full stack developers design and develop everything
                        users interact with—this includes writing clean and responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as
                        well as using popular frameworks like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js to create dynamic user
                        interfaces. On the backend, they work with server-side programming languages such as Node.js,
                        Python (with Django or Flask), Java, or PHP, managing data, authentication, APIs, and
                        application logic. They also interact with databases, both SQL (like MySQL and PostgreSQL) and
                        NoSQL (like MongoDB), to store, retrieve, and update information securely and efficiently.

                        In addition to coding, full stack developers often handle version control using Git and GitHub,
                        implement RESTful APIs, manage server deployment using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Netlify,
                        and apply basic DevOps principles to monitor and optimize app performance. Their ability to
                        understand and contribute to both sides of a web project makes them incredibly valuable in agile
                        teams and startup environments where flexibility and speed are essential.

                        Learning full stack development not only gives you the skills to build complete web applications
                        from scratch but also empowers you to understand how all the pieces of modern web architecture
                        fit together. Whether you're aiming to become a professional developer, launch your own product,
                        or simply enhance your tech skillset, full stack development provides a powerful foundation. In
                        today’s fast-evolving digital landscape, full stack developers are in high demand for their
                        versatility, efficiency, and problem-solving capabilities.</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-4" style="color: #FFB823;">Sql</h4>
                    <p style="color: #708A58;">SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to communicate with and manage
                        relational databases. It allows developers, data analysts, and software engineers to efficiently
                        store, retrieve, manipulate, and organize data stored in structured tables. SQL is essential in
                        almost every modern application, from web platforms and mobile apps to enterprise software, as
                        data is at the heart of all digital services. With SQL, users can write queries to select
                        specific data, insert new records, update existing values, or delete unwanted information, all
                        using straightforward and highly readable syntax.

                        Beyond basic queries, SQL supports powerful features such as joining multiple tables, applying
                        filters and conditions, using aggregations (like COUNT, SUM, AVG), and organizing results
                        through sorting and grouping. More advanced SQL operations include nested queries (subqueries),
                        transactions, stored procedures, and user permissions management, which are crucial for building
                        scalable and secure systems. Common relational database management systems (RDBMS) that use SQL
                        include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

                        In the world of data-driven decision-making, SQL has become an essential skill—not just for
                        developers, but also for business analysts, marketers, and data scientists. It's used to extract
                        insights from large datasets, power dashboards, and integrate with backend APIs. Mastery of SQL
                        opens doors to a wide range of career paths and is considered a fundamental building block in
                        full stack development, data analytics, and software engineering. Whether you're managing user
                        accounts, handling financial records, or powering a search engine, SQL gives you the tools to
                        interact with data intelligently and securely.
